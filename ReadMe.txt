Purification.m
Description: This MATLAB script purifies the training pixels based on two criteria: Euclidean Distance (ED) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithms. The Spectral Information Divergence (SID) parameter is not used for purification in this script, but it can be added if needed.


SAM_SID.m
Description: This MATLAB function calculates SAM, ED, and SID based on the algorithms described in "R. Pu, Hyperspectral Remote Sensing: Fundamentals and Practices. CRC Press, 2017."


RF_classification.py
Description: This Python script runs a Random Forest algorithm on the dataset.
